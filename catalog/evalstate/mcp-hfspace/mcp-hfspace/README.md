> Repository: [evalstate/mcp-hfspace](https://github.com/evalstate/mcp-hfspace)

## Description

Read the introduction here [llmindset.co.uk/resources/mcp-hfspace/](https://llmindset.co.uk/resources/mcp-hfspace/)


## Usage

The containers are built automatically and are available on the GitHub Container Registry.

1. Pull the Docker image:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/metorial/mcp-container--evalstate--mcp-hfspace--mcp-hfspace
```

2. Run the container:

```bash
docker run -it --rm ghcr.io/metorial/mcp-container--evalstate--mcp-hfspace--mcp-hfspace 
```

- `--rm` removes the container after it exits, so you don't have to clean up manually.
- `-it` allows you to interact with the container in your terminal.
